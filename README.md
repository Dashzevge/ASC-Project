Problem Statement:

For maintenance workers, cleaners, plumbers, electricians, and painters seeking side jobs, finding reliable, relevant work is a challenge. Current job platforms are often too generalized, making it difficult for skilled tradespeople to connect with local, short-term opportunities that match their specific expertise and availability. Likewise, homeowners and businesses looking to hire for these specialized services often face difficulties in finding trustworthy and qualified workers quickly and affordably.

Goal:

To create a dedicated platform connecting maintenance professionals (such as cleaners, plumbers, electricians, and painters) with clients needing skilled help for short-term jobs. The platform will streamline the process of finding, booking, and managing skilled labor for both parties, allowing tradespeople to easily find local side jobs in their area of expertise, while ensuring clients have access to vetted professionals who meet their specific needs.
